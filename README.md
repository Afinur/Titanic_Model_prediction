# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

Predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning based on factors like age, gender, and passenger class.

# Project Overview

 This project aims to build a predictive model for Titanic passenger survival. The workflow includes:

 1️⃣ Data Cleaning

   Handle missing values in features like Age and Fare using mean imputation.

 2️⃣ Feature Engineering

   Convert categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) into numerical format using encoding techniques.

 3️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation

   Compare multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best-performing model.

# Technologies Used

  Python

  Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation

  Scikit-learn – Preprocessing and ML models

  XGBoost – Gradient boosting for high performance
