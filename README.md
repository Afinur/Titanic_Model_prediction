# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

Predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning based on factors like age, gender, and passenger class.

📋 Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model for Titanic passenger survival. The workflow includes:

  Data Cleaning

  Handling missing values in features like Age and Fare using mean imputation.

  Feature Engineering

  Converting categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) into numerical format with encoding techniques.

  Model Training & Evaluation

  Comparing multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best-performing model.

🛠 Technologies Used

  Python

  Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation

  Scikit-learn – Preprocessing and ML models

  XGBoost – Gradient boosting for high performance
